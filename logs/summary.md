# AI Prompt Generation Refinement - Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Structured System Prompts
- Created clear, well-defined system prompts as constants
- Added detailed instructions for AI to follow specific output formats
- Implemented separate prompts for different review types (general review, complex function review)
- Added explicit instructions for JSON formatting

### 2. Enhanced JSON Output
- Added `response_format={"type": "json_object"}` parameter to OpenAI API calls
- Implemented JSON validation to ensure responses contain required fields
- Added fallback handling for non-JSON responses
- Structured the output format to include categories, severity levels, and detailed suggestions

### 3. Improved CLI Output Formatting
- Added visual indicators (emojis) for different suggestion types
- Implemented categorization of suggestions by type (security, performance, etc.)
- Added severity markers to highlight critical issues
- Improved overall readability with better spacing and formatting

### 4. Comprehensive Logging
- Added detailed logging throughout the suggestion generation process
- Included debug logs for API calls and response parsing
- Added error logging with full traceback information
- Implemented validation warnings for incomplete AI responses

### 5. Documentation Updates
- Updated README.md with information about the enhanced AI review capabilities
- Added examples of the improved CLI output
- Updated progress and validation logs to reflect the changes

## Benefits

1. **More Actionable Feedback**: The structured format ensures that suggestions are specific and actionable.
2. **Better Prioritization**: Categorization and severity levels help users focus on the most important issues.
3. **Improved Readability**: Enhanced CLI output makes it easier to understand and act on suggestions.
4. **Better Debugging**: Comprehensive logging helps identify and fix issues in the AI review process.
5. **Consistent Output**: Structured JSON format ensures consistent parsing and integration with other tools.

## Next Steps

1. **Automated Security Scanning**: Integrate dedicated security scanning tools to complement AI reviews.
2. **Unit Testing**: Add comprehensive tests for the suggestion generation and parsing logic.
3. **Real-World Testing**: Test with a variety of codebases to ensure the AI provides valuable suggestions.
4. **Plugin System**: Complete the plugin system to allow for custom analyzers and suggestion generators.
