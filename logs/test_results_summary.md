# Test Results Summary

## Overview

The comprehensive test suite for the AI Code Review Tool has been successfully executed, validating all core features of the local MVP. The tests were designed to ensure that each component of the system functions correctly and integrates well with other components.

## Test Results

All tests have passed successfully:

| Test | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| AI-powered code review | ✅ PASSED | Verified the `SuggestionGenerator` class functionality, including suggestion generation and AI review capabilities. |
| Security scanning | ✅ PASSED | Confirmed that the `SecurityScanner` can detect various security vulnerabilities, including hardcoded credentials. |
| Dependency scanning | ✅ PASSED | Validated that the `DependencyScanner` can identify vulnerable dependencies in both Python and JavaScript/TypeScript projects. |
| UI validation | ✅ PASSED | Tested the `UIValidator` class for comparing screenshots and generating reports in different formats. |
| Report generation | ✅ PASSED | Verified that the `ReportGenerator` can create comprehensive reports in both JSON and Markdown formats. |
| CLI functionality | ✅ PASSED | Confirmed that the command-line interface works correctly, including argument parsing and error handling. |
